# pthread_library
User-defined pthread synchronization library.

This library can be integrated into any program that uses pthreads by following these steps:
  1.) Make the pthread library object file: g++ -c -o threads.o threads.cpp -m32
  2.) Include 'pthread.h' in the source code of the program: #include <pthread.h>
  3.) Include the object file in the compilation step of the program: g++ -o my_program my_program.c threads.o -m32

Currently, this library supports:
  1.) Thread synchornization functions such as:
    - pthread_create()
    - pthread_exit()
    - pthread_self()
    - pthread_join()

  2.) Mutex functions:
    - lock()
    - unlock()

  3.) Semaphore functions:
    - sem_init()
    - sem_destroy()
    - sem_wait()
    - sem_post()
